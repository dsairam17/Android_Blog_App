# Android-Blog-App

An Android application to view the posts posted on the web server. The webserver uses custom API's to send JSON object for the requested data from android users.

Firebase Cloud Messaging is used to send notification to all registered users when a new post is posted on the website.

Also implemented a discussion forum using firebase realtime database where users can discuss with their peers to share their thoughts and clear doubts.

End.
